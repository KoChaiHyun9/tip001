// Describes when the clients can retry a failed request. Clients could ignore
// the recommendation here or retry when this information is missing from error
// responses.
//
// It's always recommended that clients should use exponential backoff when
// retrying.
//
// Clients should wait until `retry_delay` amount of time has passed since
// receiving the error response before retrying.  If retrying requests also
// fail, clients should use an exponential backoff scheme to gradually increase
// the delay between retries based on `retry_delay`, until either a maximum
// number of retires have been reached or a maximum retry delay cap has been
// reached.
// File 정보 저장
// Describes additional debugging info.
// Describes how a quota check failed.
//
// For example if a daily limit was exceeded for the calling project,
// a service could respond with a QuotaFailure detail containing the project
// id and the description of the quota limit that was exceeded.  If the
// calling project hasn't enabled the service in the developer console, then
// a service could respond with the project id and set `service_disabled`
// to true.
//
// Also see RetryDetail and Help types for other details about handling a
// quota failure.
// Describes what preconditions have failed.
//
// For example, if an RPC failed because it required the Terms of Service to be
// acknowledged, it could list the terms of service violation in the
// PreconditionFailure message.
// Describes violations in a client request. This error type focuses on the
// syntactic aspects of the request.
// Contains metadata about the request that clients can attach when filing a bug
// or providing other forms of feedback.
// Describes the resource that is being accessed.
// Provides links to documentation or for performing an out of band action.
//
// For example, if a quota check failed with an error indicating the calling
// project hasn't enabled the accessed service, this can contain a URL pointing
// directly to the right place in the developer console to flip the bit.
// Provides a localized error message that is safe to return to the user
// which can be attached to an RPC error.
